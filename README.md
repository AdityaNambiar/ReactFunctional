A ReactJS web application that is built to be production ready (currently learning & working to make changes) 
and has a node server to communicate with the help of relative URL. 

Speciality of this react application is that it demonstrates use of React Hooks in functional components. 
Gotta say they are pretty handy.

- Understand how to utilize Webpack bundler to create 'reverse proxy' for avoiding "CORS" issues on stringent secure browsers like Chrome and also help you to avoid port mapping issues and dependency occuring due to hard-coding ports.

- A sample GitHub repository that can serve as an example for understanding how these actually work. This linked repository is also the reason why I wanted to use ReactHooks and functional components.
